# TechSolutions Ghana – Python Data Analysis Case Study

Welcome to the TechSolutions Ghana business analysis project — a deep dive into client retention, project delivery efficiency, and service performance using Python. This data-driven case study explores real business challenges in an IT consulting firm and provides strategic insights through clean, compelling analysis.

---

## Background

**TechSolutions Ghana** is a small but growing IT consulting firm offering:
- Software Development
- Cybersecurity Services
- IT Infrastructure Solutions

### Business Challenges:
1. Low client retention — clients rarely return after one project.
2. Frequent project delays — services often exceed estimated timelines.
3. Underperforming services — some service categories show weak revenue and uptake.

The CEO’s question was clear:
> “How can we use data to improve client retention, optimize project delivery, and focus on the most profitable IT services?”

---

## Project Goals

- Analyze trends in client engagement and repeat business.
- Identify bottlenecks in project timelines and service delivery.
- Break down revenue contributions across service categories.
- Recommend business strategies based on clean, well-visualized data.

## Key Findings

- **Client Retention**: Over 50% of clients didn’t return after their first engagement.
- **Project Delays**: Average delay across services was ~2.5 weeks, with software projects most affected.
- **Service Performance**: Cybersecurity services outperformed others in both revenue and repeat business.
- **Revenue Trends**: A small subset of services contributed the bulk of total revenue.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Retention Strategy**: Introduce loyalty programs, post-service surveys, and engagement pipelines.
2. **Efficiency Boost**: Standardize project workflows and track delivery KPIs using project management tools.
3. **Revenue Optimization**: Double down on high-performing services; phase out or repackage low-demand ones.

---

## Future Directions

- Add customer satisfaction scoring models using survey data.
- Build a lightweight churn prediction model using Python’s scikit-learn.
- Integrate periodic email reporting using automated Python scripts.
